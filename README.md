🏠 Homeland  
📌 **Project Description**  
This project is a static and responsive web page called **Homeland**, inspired by the theme _“De Pátria para Pátria”_ — a symbolic journey that connects people and cultures from different parts of the world.

The page includes:

- A **header** with the project logo.
- A **main section** with a title, subtitle, and main image.
- An **intro section** featuring a quote, the author’s name, and descriptive text about the project.
- A **footer** with credits and copyright information.

🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Favicon SVG** → custom site icon

🎨 **Layout and Responsiveness**

The layout was developed with a **mobile-first** approach and uses **relative units** (`%`, `vw`, `clamp()`) for a fluid design that adapts naturally to different screen sizes.  
Media queries are minimal and used only when necessary to refine spacing or text alignment.

🔧 **Future Improvements**

Planned updates to enhance functionality and appearance:

- Add smooth scrolling and subtle animations.

- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, focus states).

- Implement advanced media queries for tablets and ultra-wide screens.

- Add a theme switch (light/dark mode).

- Include more sections with photos and short descriptions from different regions.
