‚ú® **Main Features**

- **Multiple Content Sections:**  
  Each `place` section tells a story about a specific location, using images and texts for immersion.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Built mobile-first using relative units (`%`, `vw`, `clamp()`). Uses media queries to adjust typography, spacing, and layout at different breakpoints.
- **Scoped Custom Styles:**  
  Uses BEM modifiers (e.g. `.place__paragraph-text`, `.place__paragraph-text:nth-of-type(3)`) for precise individual section or element customization.
- **Accessibility:**  
  Semantic HTML structure, descriptive alt text for all images.
- **External References:**  
  Country/location links open in new tabs for extra context.
- **Organized Code:**  
  No selector repetition for base elements. Media-query styles and element variants are grouped for clarity.
